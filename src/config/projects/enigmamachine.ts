  title: "Enigma Machine",

  shortDescription:
    "An interactive educational application that helps introductory computer science students explore encryption through a visual cipher machine.",

  description:
    "An educational technology project developed to make introductory encryption concepts more interactive and approachable for computer science students. " +
    "The application allows students to experiment with a virtual cipher machine and observe how input is transformed into encrypted output. " +
    "By combining interactive visualization with hands-on experimentation, the project turns an abstract computer science concept into an experience students can directly explore.",

  featured: false,

  role:
    "I worked as an undergraduate developer on the project, helping design and program the interactive learning experience in Unity. " +
    "My responsibilities included implementing application behavior, building interactive interfaces, creating visual feedback for the cipher process, testing the application, and refining the experience for use by introductory computer science students.",

  problem:
    "Encryption can be difficult for beginner computer science students to understand when it is introduced only through written explanations, diagrams, or algorithms. " +
    "Students may understand the individual steps conceptually without seeing how those steps work together to transform information.",

  solution:
    "I helped develop an interactive cipher-machine experience that allows students to provide input and visually observe how it is transformed through the encryption process. " +
    "The application presents the underlying concept through direct interaction and visual feedback, giving students an opportunity to experiment with encryption instead of only reading about it. " +
    "The goal was to make the relationship between input, cipher behavior, and encrypted output easier to understand.",
