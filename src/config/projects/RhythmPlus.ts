  title: "Rhythm Plus",

  shortDescription:
    "A physical rhythm game that combines real-time software logic, state management, and hardware inputs to recreate a tile-based music experience.",

  description:
    "Rhythm Plus is a class project where I developed a physical version of a tile-based rhythm game using Arduino and software engineering fundamentals. " +
    "The project focused on designing responsive game logic, managing player input, coordinating timing-based events, and integrating software behavior with physical hardware.",

  category: "Embedded Systems",

  date: "Apr. 2024 – Jun. 2024",

  status: "completed",

  technologies: ["Arduino", "Embedded Systems", "Hardware", "C++"],

  featured: false,

  role:
    "I designed and programmed the game's core software logic, including player input handling, game states, timing behavior, and communication between the software and physical components. " +
    "I also helped structure the system so that input, game logic, and hardware output could operate together reliably during gameplay.",

  problem:
    "I wanted to recreate the responsiveness of a digital rhythm game using physical controls. " +
    "The main challenge was coordinating timing-sensitive player input, game state, and hardware behavior so that the experience remained responsive and consistent.",

  solution:
    "I developed a software-driven game loop that processed physical player inputs, tracked the current game state, and triggered the appropriate game responses based on timing. " +
    "The software coordinated the Arduino's input and output components while separating gameplay logic from hardware interaction, making the system easier to test, debug, and extend.",
