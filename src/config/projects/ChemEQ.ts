  title: "ChemEQ",

  shortDescription:
    "An interactive chemistry learning application that helps students visualize dynamic equilibrium through real-time molecular simulations.",

  description:
    "ChemEQ is an interactive educational application developed to help undergraduate chemistry students better understand dynamic chemical equilibrium. " +
    "The application visualizes the equilibrium between NO₂ and N₂O₄ and allows students to manipulate conditions such as concentration, temperature, and pressure. " +
    "As these variables change, students receive visual feedback showing how the chemical system responds, making an abstract chemistry concept easier to explore and understand.",

  featured: true,

  role: "My responsibilities included programming interactive systems in Unity, implementing the student interface, creating visual feedback for chemical reactions, testing the application, and refining the experience based on classroom needs.",

  problem:
    "Dynamic chemical equilibrium can be difficult for students to understand because the reactions occur at the molecular level and cannot be directly observed. " +
    "Traditional diagrams and equations explain the concept mathematically, but they do not always help students develop an intuitive understanding of how a system responds when concentration, temperature, or pressure changes.",

  solution:
    "I helped develop an interactive simulation that allows students to directly manipulate the conditions of a chemical equilibrium system and observe the results visually. " +
    "The application models the equilibrium between NO₂ and N₂O₄, allowing students to adjust concentration, temperature, and pressure while seeing how the molecular population responds. " +
    "By combining interactive controls with visual molecular feedback, the application turns an abstract chemistry concept into an experience students can experiment with and observe in real time.",
