  title: "Crisp Car (Autonomous Car)",

  shortDescription:
    "A miniature autonomous vehicle that uses computer vision to follow lanes, recognize traffic signs, and make real-time navigation decisions.",

  description:
    "A senior design project developed alongside three teammates to build a miniature autonomous vehicle capable of navigating a roadway using computer vision. " +
    "The vehicle processes camera input in real time to identify lane markings, recognize traffic signs, and determine how it should respond to its environment. " +
    "The project combined computer vision, autonomous navigation, and software-controlled vehicle behavior into a complete real-time system.",

  role:
    "I worked as a Software Engineer on a four-person team, focusing on the computer vision and autonomous navigation systems. " +
    "My responsibilities included processing camera input with OpenCV, implementing lane-following behavior, developing traffic sign recognition, and connecting visual detections to the vehicle's driving decisions.",

  problem:
    "The vehicle needed to navigate a miniature roadway autonomously while responding to visual information in real time. " +
    "This required the software to reliably identify lane boundaries and traffic signs from a continuously changing camera feed, then translate those detections into appropriate navigation behavior.",

  solution:
    "We developed a computer vision pipeline using OpenCV to process live camera input and identify important features of the roadway. " +
    "Lane detection was used to determine the vehicle's position relative to the path and continuously adjust its movement to remain on course. " +
    "Traffic sign recognition allowed the vehicle to detect environmental instructions and modify its behavior accordingly. " +
    "These systems were integrated with the vehicle's navigation logic to create a real-time feedback loop between visual perception and autonomous movement.",
